# English-to-Chinese Translation

Produce natural, accurate Chinese translations that read as if written by a native speaker — free of 翻译腔 (translationese) and AI slop patterns.

## Overview

AI models produce predictable defects in Chinese translation: English word order calqued into Chinese, filler phrases added for politeness, over-emphasis not present in the source, and tone shifts. This skill provides a structured iterative workflow to eliminate these issues through comprehension, translation, and repeated polish passes.

## When to Use

- Translating documents, articles, or prose from English to Chinese
- Improving or polishing an existing Chinese translation
- Reviewing machine-translated Chinese content for quality

## When NOT to Use

- Translating into languages other than Chinese
- Translating non-English source text
- Writing original Chinese content (not a translation)
- Quick gloss translations where quality is unimportant

## Translation Workflow

### Phase 1: Comprehension

Read the full English source document before translating anything.

Identify ambiguous passages, domain-specific terminology, and phrases that could be interpreted multiple ways. Present ambiguities in a table:

| English Passage | Possible Meanings | Chosen Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| ... | ... | ... |

For unresolved terminology:
1. Explore the project context (README, codebase, related docs) for usage conventions.
2. If ambiguity persists, stop and ask the user.

Do not proceed to translation until all ambiguities are resolved.

### Phase 2: Initial Translation

Translate the full document in one pass. During the initial draft:

- Preserve all formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, links, images)
- Keep proper nouns untranslated (product names, project names, person names)
- Translate technical terms by established convention (e.g., "machine learning" → "机器学习")
- Match the source tone and formality level
- Do not polish during this phase — produce a complete draft first

### Phase 3: Iterative Polish

Run a minimum of **3 rounds**. Each round performs three distinct checks in order. If any round produces changes, run one additional round after the minimum 3.

#### Accuracy Check

Compare translated text against the English source line by line. Fix:

- 含义改变 — meaning differs from source
- 添油加醋 — content added that source does not contain
- 遗漏 — content present in source but missing from translation
- 格式改变 — formatting broken (headings, links, code blocks)
- 标点符号 — English punctuation left in Chinese text, or wrong Chinese punctuation
- 语法错误 — grammatical errors in Chinese

#### Fluency Check

Read the Chinese text without referring to the English source. Fix:

- 英语语序 — English word order literally transplanted into Chinese
- 费解的表述 — phrasing that requires re-reading to understand
- 缺少衔接 — missing transitions between sentences or paragraphs
- 不自然的搭配 — word combinations no native Chinese speaker would use
- 能否改用更自然的表述 — rephrase for naturalness without changing meaning

#### AI Slop Check

Detect and remove AI-specific defect patterns:

- 过度强调 — excessive emphasis ("极其", "至关重要" where source says "important")
- 废话填充 — filler phrases not in source ("值得注意的是", "不言而喻", "毋庸置疑")
- 不自然的客套 — unnatural hedging or politeness not matching source tone
- 原文没有的展开 — elaboration added beyond what source states
- 翻译腔 — literal calques, unnatural collocations, mechanical "的" chains

For a detailed catalog of these patterns with examples, consult **`references/translation-examples.md`**.

### Final Validation

After iterative polish converges (a round produces zero changes):

1. Read the complete Chinese document from start to finish, as a Chinese reader, without referring to the English source.
2. Ask: does this read like a native Chinese speaker wrote it? Any AI slop indicators or 翻译腔 remaining?
3. If any issue is found, return to Phase 3 for another round.
4. Claim translation complete only when the full read-through raises no issues.

Do not rush this step.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| 1. Comprehension | Read source, list ambiguities, resolve terminology | Full understanding |
| 2. Initial Translation | Translate in one pass, preserve formatting | Complete draft |
| 3. Iterative Polish | Accuracy → Fluency → AI Slop, minimum 3 rounds | High quality |
| 4. Final Validation | Full read-through as Chinese reader | Confirm quality |
